# 🐦 Flappy Bird AI using Deep Q-Network (DQN)

Built using PyTorch and Reinforcement Learning.

## Overview

This project implements a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent that learns to play Flappy Bird using **Reinforcement Learning**.

The agent starts with no prior knowledge of the game and learns through trial and error by interacting with the environment, storing experiences in replay memory, and improving its policy over time.

## 🚀 Features

- Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- Experience Replay
- Target Network Synchronization
- Epsilon-Greedy Exploration
- PyTorch-based Neural Network
- Gymnasium Flappy Bird Environment

## 🧠 How It Works

The agent observes the game state and chooses between two actions:

| Action | Description |
|----------|------------|
| 0 | Do Nothing |
| 1 | Flap |

The neural network predicts Q-values for each action, and the agent selects actions that maximize long-term rewards.

## 📈 Training

The agent was trained using:

- Deep Q-Learning
- Experience Replay Buffer
- Target Network
- Epsilon Decay Strategy

During training, the agent gradually learned to survive longer and successfully navigate through obstacles.
